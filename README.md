# What to Expect When You're Expecting Module 5

Now is the time to show off all of the skills you have gained while here at Flatiron School. Flex those mental muscles and get prepared to become a developer!

## Friday of Module 4

Time to start thinking about ideas. By Monday, come up with two ideas, and tell us about them in [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/fqS2zidl2XJxRwRg2). On Monday we will have a conversation with each student about adjusting the scope and choosing an idea that we know is doable in the time allotted and uses technologies that companies are looking for.

We will get back to you with which project idea to pursue by lunch on Monday.

#### ACTION ITEMS

 * Complete Project Proposal form by Monday morning - https://goo.gl/forms/fqS2zidl2XJxRwRg2

## Week 1

### Monday and Tuesday

For the first few days of Week 1 you'll be finishing up learning Redux. In addition to that you will be required to spend some time thinking out and planning your project. You will work with the instructors to scope and plan the project via 1:1s on Monday and Tuesday afternoon. 

Here you should be thinking about three things and trying to find their intersect:

1. What am I interested in creating? Is there a size appropriate problem I can create a solution to?
2. What type of web development do you want to work in and what are some common technologies/libraries that those verticals use which you can implement in your project?
3. What do you think you can accomplish in the time allotted? Focus on 3 features at 100% over 10 features at 50% -- Quality over quantity!

In addition to finishing up Redux lectures, spend a bit of time planning out your application. Feel free to reach out to instructors for any guidance, but we'd like everyone to have the following things:

#### Wireframes/User Stories

The goal here is to figure out the first few (2-4) user stories and wireframe them out. User stories are a single sentence description of a goal/problem that a user can solve using your application. [Here is some more details](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories). You are welcome to do this however you'd like but make sure they are low-fidelity. Pen and paper is fine! These will all inevitably change so spending too much time here isn't worth it. An online tool that a lot of students enjoy is [fluidUI](https://www.fluidui.com/).

#### Component Structure

Write down in a Google doc, include it in your README, or design it out with pen and paper. Our component structure will represent our React application skeleton. You'll need to consider the following:

 1. What components do I have? 
 2. What are the parent-child relationships between my components?
 3. What props/state should each component have, and where is it receiving its props/state from?

#### Data Model

Write down in a Google doc, design it with [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com), or design it out with pen and paper. You'll need three things included in the data model:

 1. What tables will you have
 2. What fields are in those tables
 3. How the tables are related

#### Technologies Used

Write down in a google doc, include it in a README or write it on a piece of paper. What technologies are you using? Notably please include any external APIs. 

#### States

Quickly design out the JS object that will represent your state. This should include all of the things that the application may need on the front end!

#### Examples from previous classes

 * [Foodmore](https://github.com/linvvian/foodamore-app)
 * [FixMyCity](https://github.com/nkernis/FixMyCity)
 * [scrpt](https://github.com/anneeb/scrpt)

### Wednesday

In the morning students will present their wireframes and project ideas to the class. Collect feedback from the class wherever possible!

After project work, it's off to the races! Start breaking down your wireframes and user stories into some code. 

### Thursday

This will be the first day of execution mode. The goal is by the end of Wednesday of week 2 to have a completed MVP. In an effort to hit that goal every day students must submit a daily check in. The 
is located [here](https://goo.gl/forms/QJ6d4WNJxmWaBprK2) and should only take 5 minutes to complete every morning.

We will use this information to understand which students need more help. 

This will also be the first day of dedicated project 1:1s with the Lead instructor. You will receive an invite for a 1:1 sometime before Wednesday MVPs being due. Use this time however you'd like. Project planning, technical concerns, general advice are all fine. Students will receive two 1:1s with a lead, and two 1:1s with a junior instructor during their time in Module 5.

### Friday

Friday will be another execution day. Some students will have 1:1s with the lead as well. Daily Check in form is here: https://goo.gl/forms/QJ6d4WNJxmWaBprK2

In the afternoon we'll do a group standup with your instructor for everyone to share their current status and any challenges they are facing.

## Week 2

MVPs are due Wednesday and Concentrations begin on Thursday!

### Monday and Tuesday

Execution and coding days! Daily check in form is here: https://goo.gl/forms/QJ6d4WNJxmWaBprK2.

In the afternoons students will have progress check ins with their instructors to be sure Wednesday will be a successful day!

### Wednesday

MVP Presentation Day! Yet again fill out your daily check in form and prep for showing off your MVP. During your MVP Presentation you should present two things:

 1. A Walk through of your app accomplishing the goals you set out at the beginning
 2. The next features you'll be working on

Also on Wednesday morning we will distribute the concentration choosing form. After everyone submits their preferences we will have a few conversations with students who we may recommend different concentrations given their projects. 

### Thursday

#### Concentrations

These concentrations will be independent study with student-led discussion groups in the morning where students present on topics pertaining to the concentration. This will prepare you to research and teach yourself new topics like you will as a working developer.  While we want students to understand the material, a primary goal is teach students how to learn on their own. These concentrations will be discussing reading documentation and learning how to apply tutorials on the web to code that you are writing.

Concentration Options are:
- Advanced Redux
- OO patterns
- Performance
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Node/MongoDB (must get approved)

### Friday

Since your MVP is complete, you will be moving on to other nice to have features. This is another execution day. Fill out the daily checkin in the morning and keep working and asking questions!

Friday afternoon we'll do another group standup checkin. 

## Week 3

### Monday - Wednesday

Execution days. Fill out the daily check ins form and folks will still be receiving 1:1s with Junior and Lead Instructors. Please complete your work by the end of day on **Tuesday**. Spend Wednesday fixing bugs and refining.

### Thursday

Science Fair Day! Make sure to not make any last minute large changes and prep for the science fair in the afternoon.

### Friday

Graduation!

After Graduation, we'll lead a deployment to Heroku session for those who want it and who's code is bug-free enough to be able to be deployed and shown to employers.
